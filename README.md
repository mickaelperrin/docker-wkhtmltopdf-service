# wkhtmltopdf as a web service

A dockerized webservice written in [Go](https://golang.org/) that uses [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to convert HTML into documents (images or pdf files).

## Fork

The fork introduce the following modifications:
- use latest wkhtmltopdf version
- support for multiple Urls combined in one PDF

**Example:** 

```
{
  "urls": {
    "http://www.google.com",
    "http://www.reddit.com",
  },
  "options": {
    "margin-bottom": "1cm",
    "orientation": "Landscape",
    "grayscale": true
  },
  "cookies": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "foo"
  }
}
```

## Usage

The service listens on port 3000 for POST requests on the root path (`/`). Any other method returns a `405 not allowed` status. Any other path returns a `404 not found` status.

The body should contain a JSON-encoded object containing the following parameters:

- **url**: The URL of the page to convert.
- **output**: The type of document to generate, can be either `jpg`, `png` or `pdf`. Defauts to `pdf` if not specified. Depending on the output type the appropriate binary is called.
- **options**: A list of key-value arguments that are passed on to the appropriate `wkhtmltopdf` binary. Boolean values are interpreted as flag arguments (e.g.: `--greyscale`).
- **cookies**: A list of key-value arguments that are passed on to the appropriate `wkhtmltopdf` binary as separate `cookie` arguments.

**Example:** posting the following JSON:

```
{
  "url": "http://www.google.com",
  "options": {
    "margin-bottom": "1cm",
    "orientation": "Landscape",
    "grayscale": true
  },
  "cookies": {
    "foo": "bar",
    "baz": "foo"
  }
}
```

will have the effect of the following command-line being executed on the server:

```
/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf --margin-bottom 1cm --orientation Landscape --grayscale --cookie foo bar --cookie baz foo http://www.google.com -
```

The `-` at the end of the command-line is so that the document contents are redirected to stdout so we can in turn redirect it to the web server's response stream.

When using `jpg` or `png` output, the set of options you can pass are actually more limited. Please check [wkhtmltopdf usage docs](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/docs.html) or rather just use `wkhtmltopdf --help` or `wkhtmltoimage --help` to get help on the available command-line arguments.


## Known limitations / TODOs

This service doesn't currently accept or convert raw HTML. We found that it's difficult to render raw HTML when you have relative links in the page. There are known workarounds that we haven't yet tried (see [this stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21775572/wkhtmltopdf-relative-paths-in-html-with-redirected-in-out-streams-wont-work) for more information).

The server currently does not check if the arguments are valid, just passes them on to the `wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage` binaries. If you pass a wrong argument you don't currently get an error, just an empty image or pdf back.
